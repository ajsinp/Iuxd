        <h1 style="padding: 20px;">The idea for Parabolic was conceived while attending an anarchist and crypto festival in Acapulco, 
            Mexico back in early 2018. We wanted to go to the edge of society and experience the conve
            rsations going on at the frontlines of liberalism and tech - far away fromavian nest.</h1>

            <h6>Amid all the madness and lunch-sized Pina Coladas also came time for conversation
                and reflection. What is it we want from life? Who do we want to spend.

                <h6>We met people who believed the world is run by reptilian overlords. Witnessed a heavy verbal infight between 
                Roger Ver and the audience about Bitcoin Cash and hard forks - yes, he actually cried on stage. Partied with 
                members from the Wu Tang Clan at a bar overlooking Acapulco Bay. Felt the shocks of an earthquake measuring 7.2 
                on the Richter Scale. Befriended a group of guys from Venezuela who ran an exchange that could get people out 
                of the inflated Bolivar. Met a family who voluntarily lived without personal identification and had spent 
                months traveling through the US and Mexico to reach the resort. Released turtles into the Pacific under the 
                full moon.

                <h6>Amid all the madness and lunch-sized Pina Coladas also came time for conversation
                    and reflection. What is it we want from life? Who do we want to spend our precious time with? Are
                     we free to do whatever we want? Can we help some people less fortunate than ourselves?
                    We ended up breaking our corporate chains and create an independant venture design studio that builds cutting edge new companies with visions and values we believe in. With Parabolic we wanted to challenge the misguided ways traditional studios are working - instead of an hourly rate, we wish to be paid for the value o
                   f the outcome, as incentives align better this way.
